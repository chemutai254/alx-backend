# 0x01. Caching

## Cache Algorithms
- Aka Cache Replacement Algorithms or Cache Replacement Policies.
- Cache algorithms are optimizing instructions, or algorithms,
 that a computer program or a hardware-maintained structure
 can utilize in order to manage a cache of information stored on
 the computer.
- Caching improves performance by keeping recent or often-used
 data items in memory locations that are faster or computationally
 cheaper to access than normal memory stores.

## Cache Policies include:
- FIFO
- LIFO
- LRU
- MRU
- LFU
